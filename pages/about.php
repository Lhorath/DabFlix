        <p>
            Welcome to Dacks-Site, your personal media center designed to bring your entire collection of movies, TV shows, and music together in one clean, easy-to-use interface. Our goal is to provide a seamless and enjoyable media consumption experience, allowing you to access your content from anywhere.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            In a world of scattered files and multiple streaming services, we believe in the power of owning and organizing your own media. This project was born from a desire to create a simple, yet powerful, platform that puts you in control of your library. No more searching through folders or wondering what to watch nextâ€”everything is organized, tagged, and ready for you.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">The Technology</h2>
        <p>
            This website is built using a combination of modern web technologies to ensure it is both robust and flexible. The backend is powered by PHP, handling the file system scanning and database interactions. We use a MySQL database to store metadata for all your media, making lookups fast and efficient. The front-end player is built with HTML5, CSS (via Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript, utilizing the powerful Howler.js library to ensure smooth and reliable audio playback across all browsers.
