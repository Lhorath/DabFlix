RewriteEngine On

# Set the base directory for the rewrite rules
# This should match your subfolder on the server, e.g., /the_files/
RewriteBase /

# --- Conditions: Do not rewrite if it's a real file or directory ---
# This prevents the rule from applying to existing files like images or CSS.
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

# --- The Rule: Rewrite everything else to index.php ---
# This captures the request (e.g., "about" or "tv-shows") and passes it to index.php
# as a 'page' parameter, for example: index.php?page=tv-shows
RewriteRule ^([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)/?$ index.php?page=$1 [L,QSA]
